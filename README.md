# Elasticsearch Vagrant 

This is a simple [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) project that installs an Elasticsearch instance.

Running 'vagrant up' in the project directory should kick everything off and once installation is complete, you should be able to go to http://localhost:9200 on the host to reach the ES instance.
